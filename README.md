# Strong Normalization of the STLC in Agda [![basic](https://github.com/JonasHoefer/agda-strong-normalization/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JonasHoefer/agda-strong-normalization/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repository contains a proof that the simply typed lambda calculus is strongly normalizing.
The proof uses a standard appraoch using a logical predicate.
A rendered version of the files can be found [here](https://jonashoefer.github.io/agda-strong-normalization/STLC.html).
